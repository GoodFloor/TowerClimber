# Tower Climber

*Tower Climber* is a fast-paced 2D racing game developed using **Unreal Engine**, created as part of [*The Ultimate Unreal Engine 2D Game Development Course*](https://www.udemy.com/course/unreal-2d-course/) on **Udemy**, taught by **Cobra Code**.

## About the Game
In *Tower Climber*, the player must ascend a tall tower by jumping across platforms, avoiding hazards, and timing movements carefully. The goal is to reach the top without falling or getting hit by obstacles.

### Gameplay Mechanics
- Side-scrolling 2D platforming mechanics.
- Jumping between static and moving platforms.
- Simple enemies defeated by jumping on them

This project is designed to learn how to use free PaperZD plugin, tilests and tilemaps. In this project I also have a chance of perfecting character movement - implementing coyote time and jump buffering. Another important aspect is more complex enemy AI (compared to previous projects).

## Purpose

This is the **third project** in a series of small games built as hands-on practice for learning 2D game development in Unreal Engine through the Udemy course by Cobra Code.

## Built With

- [Unreal Engine 5.2](https://www.unrealengine.com/)
